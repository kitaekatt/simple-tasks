# Task Management System Guide

## Overview
This document describes the structure and operation of our simple task management system. It covers common operations, task types, and the use of task templates. It also provides guidance for designing effective templates.

---

## Common Operations

### 1. Create a Task (template, context)
- **Description:** Generates a unique task document from a specified template and context. The resulting document is self-contained and ready for execution.

### 2. Update a Task (task file)
- **Description:** Upgrades an existing task document to the latest template format, ensuring consistency and access to new features.

### 3. Work on a Task (task file)
- **Description:** Executes the instructions in the task document until the task is complete. The document is updated as progress is made.

---

## Task Types
- **Repeatable:** Tasks that are performed regularly or multiple times.
- **One-shot:** Tasks that are performed once and do not repeat.

Each task type has a corresponding template (see `task-type-template.md`).

---

## Task Templates
- Task templates define the structure and required information for each task type.
- New tasks are generated by filling in the template with context-specific details.
- See `task-type-template.md` for template examples.

## Template Design Tips

I've found these sections generally useful in task templates, but feel free to adapt them to your needs:

- **Version Number:** `{#.##}` Update with each template revision. Helps track and upgrade tasks.
- **Document Update Workflow:** Instruct the AI to update the document only when you say, e.g., "save this task." This creates a resumable record of the task's state.
- **Critical Documents:** `{list of document references}` List required documents that must be fully read for this task type or specific task.
- **Useful Documentations:** `{list of {document reference, context summary, for more info}}` List optional documents with a short summary and guidance on when to read the full document.
  - *Example document reference:* `./docs/terminal_best_practices.md`
  - *Example context:* Use Unix-style shell commands; create support scripts when many commands are necessary.
  - *Example for more info:* Read the full document for tips on grep, git, or script creation.
- **Objective:** `{description}` The goal the AI is working toward.
- **Project Status:** `{description}` Updated with each document revision to reflect the task's current state.
- **Retro Notes:** `{instruction}` Log non-essential notes, like tool errors and how they were resolved, to improve future work.
