# Simple Tasks: A Task Management System for AI Coding Agents

This project provides a simple, no-code task management system designed to streamline workflows with AI Coding Agents like Cursor, Windsurf, and others. The core idea is to manage tasks through markdown documents, making it easy to create, update, and work on tasks by conversing with your AI assistant.

This particular instance of the system was generated by gpt4.1-mini. You are encouraged to take the underlying generative message and create your own version with your preferred AI model â€“ Claude and Gemini are great alternatives!

## Project Genesis & Philosophy

As explained in the [original generative message](docs/GenerativeMessage.md), this project serves as an illustration of how easily a task management system can be created and extended through conversation with an AI Coding Agent. While this repository offers a functional task management system, the primary goal is to inspire you to remix the generative message and build your own customized system.

## Quick Start: How It Works

The system is designed for simplicity:

1.  **Create a Task**: Reference the `docs/task.md` file in your AI agent's chat. Ask the agent to create a new task, describing or referencing the context of your task. The agent will generate a unique task document based on a template.
2.  **Work on a Task**: Reference the generated task file and instruct your AI agent to work on that task.

That's it! The task document becomes the single source of truth for the AI to execute instructions and track progress.

## From the Original Announcement

Here's a summary of how this project was introduced:

> ### **A Simple Task System for AI Coding Agents**
>
> I'd like to share a fairly simple approach that can streamline AI Coding Agent (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) workflows. It doesn't require MCP servers, a memory system, or even...code!
>
> Under this approach, you create a new task document by referencing *`task.md`* in agent chat, and then ask the agent to create a new task while describing or referencing your task. After that, you can reference the corresponding task file and ask the agent to work on that task. That's it.
>   * Vibe Coder Instructions: Cut and paste the below instructions into cursor and hit go.
>   * Programmer Instructions: Read the instructions to understand them, modify or supplement them as you like.
>   * Reference Implementation: Generated with cursor and gpt4.1-mini with no customization instructions. https://github.com/kitaekatt/simple-tasks

## Key Documents

*   `docs/task.md`: The main guide for the task management system.
*   `docs/GenerativeMessage.md`: The prompt used to generate this system, which you can adapt to create your own.
*   `docs/task-type-template.md` and `docs/task-general-template.md`: Templates for defining tasks.
